## _Why Tech Needs More Jack-of-All-Trades: The Rise of the Generalist_
In a tech world that loves titles like “AI Specialist” and “Senior Backend Engineer,” it’s easy to overlook the people who don’t fit neatly into a box. But generalists—those curious, adaptable folks with broad skill sets—are becoming the secret sauce behind some of the most innovative and resilient teams in tech.

### The Generalist Edge
Generalists aren’t just dabblers. They’re strategic thinkers who can hop between roles, connect dots across disciplines, and communicate effectively with different stakeholders. They’re the glue in cross-functional teams, the ones who ask the “why” behind the code, and the folks who can debug both a tech stack and a team process.

### When Versatility Becomes Vital
In startups and lean teams, generalists shine. One day they're writing front-end code, the next they’re drafting user flows or helping QA. But even in larger orgs, generalists play a vital role—filling in gaps, navigating silos, and accelerating collaboration between highly specialized departments.

### Resilience in a Changing Industry
As tech evolves faster than job descriptions can keep up, generalists are built to pivot. They’re not just surviving in uncertain times—they’re thriving. Their broad base of knowledge allows them to spot trends early, retool quickly, and support innovation across teams.

### The Takeaway
Specialists are essential—but so are the bridge-builders, the cross-pollinators, the strategic floaters. It’s time tech made more room for generalists. Because in a landscape of narrow lanes, it’s the people who see the big picture who help move the whole thing forward.
